1. Auto-update function Write any script but include a function that checks itself for updates.

Example:
Host the script on github and have it check the md5sum of the current file being run against the md5sum of the script on github.
If the file is changed, show a prompt asking the user if he wants to update.
If yes download the latest script and replace the current one.
